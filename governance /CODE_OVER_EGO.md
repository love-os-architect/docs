# Code over Ego: The Compact
**Governance Protocol for Love-OS Kernel**

## Purpose & Scope
By using this kernel, you agree to abide by the following **Core Principles**, designed to preserve the integrity of the Love-OS philosophy.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Artificial Scarcity
- **Rule:** You shall not use this code to create monopolies, paywalls, or any form of artificial scarcity.
- **Rationale:** The logic of Love requires flow. Hoarding stops the flow and introduces "Artificial Entropy."

### 2. Return to Soil
- **Rule:** Any value generated by this OS must eventually return to the physical world (e.g., soil, seeds, gold, life).
- **Rationale:** Purely digital accumulation is considered a systemic bug ("Maya") and will lead to collapse.

### 3. Zero Resistance Clause
- **Rule:** Ego is treated as a resistance coefficient (R). To maximize performance (I = V / R), users must strive to reduce Ego.
- **Rationale:** Lower Ego → Higher Flow → Greater System Efficiency.

## Enforcement & Consequences
This agreement is **self-enforcing**:
- Violations reduce **EROI** (Energy Return on Investment).
- Persistent violations result in **network exclusion** and loss of access to collaborative benefits.
